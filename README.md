# **6. Key Insights**
**Sales Trends by Market:** *North America* and *Europe* consistently outperformed other markets with growth across all product categories.

**Most Profitable Segments:** *The corporate segment* was consistently the most profitable customer segment from 2020 to 2023.

**Profit Distribution by Market:** North America, Europe, and Australia were the most profitable regions, with *North America* leading the way.

**Best-selling products:** *Herbal Essences Bio*, a *body care* product, has been the top seller for four years, driving the highest profit margins in the industry.

**Discount Strategy Review:** The discount strategy over the last few years appears to have *negatively impacted profits*, suggesting it may not have been effective. However, this is a simplistic analysis and there could be other factors at play. For a more comprehensive analysis, other factors such as sales volume, customer retention, and market conditions should also be considered.
